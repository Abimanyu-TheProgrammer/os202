# Top 10 List of Week 10

1. [What is I/O?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMzdKTtUIFM)<br>
    In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system.
2. [I/O Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RiREDkwE)<br>
    The IO structure contains types and values common to all the input/output structures and functors. In particular, it defines the Io exception, which is used to provide structured information for any errors occurring during I/O.
    
3. [What is a serial device(port)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpOV28jAjKY)<br>
    a serial port is a serial communication interface through which information transfers in or out sequentially one bit at a time.

4. [What is a parallel device(port)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA-23HL-IpI)<br>
    A parallel port is an interface allowing a personal computer (PC) to transmit or receive data down multiple bundled cables (multiple bits simultaneously) to a peripheral device such as a printer. 
    
5. [Physical Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAVC2JwEwI)<br>
    Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU, monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.
    
6. [Virtual Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo)<br>
    Hardware virtualization is the virtualization of computers as complete hardware platforms, certain logical abstractions of their componentry, or only the functionality required to run various operating systems.

7. [Buffering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHJ8ROZQD0)<br>
    In computer science, a data buffer is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device or just before it is sent to an output device.

    Buffering works by pre-downloading and stores video in a temporary cache (the buffer) before playback begins on whatever device you are using.

    Buffering allows a streamed video or media file to be loaded while the user is watching or listening to it.

8. [I/O Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01QsW5_fuek)<br>
    Here's a video on coding a file I/O program in C

9. [Network Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8-RgR0AuS0)<br>
    Network Programming involves writing programs that communicate with other. programs across a computer network. There are many issues that arise when doing network programming which do not appear when doing single program applications.

10. [Direct Memory Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq30OAb6Ni0)<br>
    Direct memory access is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory independent of the central processing unit.
