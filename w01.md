# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh_(Secure_Shell))<br>
What is SSh?<br>
Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution.<br>

How i understand it : a remote connection that allows one to control a computer through CMD or Terminal.

2. [Two](https://www.guru99.com/the-vi-editor.html)<br>
Commands for vi editor

3. [Three](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
What is bash?<br>
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems.

4. [Four](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
What is scripting?<br>
How i understand it : in a nutshell, allows you to execute multiple commands by running a file

5. [Five](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
What is shell?<br>
How i understand it : shell allows me to use commands to interact with my computer

6. [Six](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
What is virtual memory?<br>
a section of the hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. It allows us to extend the use of physical memory by using disk. This link : https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001292.htm shows how to access virtual memory settings. Virtual memory uses both computer hardware and software to work. This link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/ explains about demand paging and how virtual memory works in an OS.<br><br>


Terms regarding virtual memory:<br><br>
Page : A page is the unit of data processed by paging(virtual memory).<br>
Paging : Paging is a computer memory management function that presents storage locations to the computer's CPU as additional memory (virtual memory itself)<br>
Logical address : a cell in the program memory<br> 
Physical address : a cell in the main memory (RAM)<br>


7. [Seven](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-hypervisor)<br>
A hypervisor is hardware, software, or firmware capable of creating virtual machines and then managing and allocating resources to them. Virtual machines are machines set up to use the resources of the host machine. A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.<br>

Types of hypervisors :<br><br>
Type 1 -> it runs on the system hardware<br>
Type 2 -> it runs on the host OS that runs virtualization services<br>

8. [Eight](https://www.hitechnectar.com/blogs/virtualization-emulation/)<br>
Virtualization is splitting a single physical computer into multiple "virtual" servers (multiple os in a single computer with a software-based cpu, ram, hard disk, etc).<br>
Emulation is a concept of creating an environment that imitates the properties of one system onto another (basically means it gives the ability to run a windows program on a mac, as i understand it).<br>

9. [Nine](https://www.techadvisory.org/2019/07/advantages-and-costs-of-virtualization/)<br>
Virtualization eliminates the need to buy a new hardware to supplement the company's requirements. 

Virtual machines take up to date snapshots of your servers and redeploy them to another device. Unlike physical servers that require you to create backups of your server and current data.

Working with virtual machines will give a company versatility, because they have the flexibility to run on differen platforms, servers, and hardwares.

Factors to consider :<br><br>

Initial set up costs.<br>
Staff skills to work with virtual machines<br>
It is effective when we have 10 - 15 servers running.<br>



10. [Ten](https://www.esds.co.in/blog/cloud-computing-types-cloud/#sthash.UxuMipCh.dpbs)<br>
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storages and more over the Internet. The companies that offer these computing services are called cloud providers. They charge for cloud computing services based on usage.<br> 
Cloud computing resource management allows access to a shared pool of resources which can be configured based on the user's demand, whereas elasticity is a process by which the cloud provider will match the resources needed by the user
