# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [What is a Deadlock?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVo9mGARkhQ)<br>
    Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 


2. [What is a Livelock?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_1unN40Os0)<br>
    Livelock occurs when two or more processes continually repeat the same interaction in response to changes in the other processes without doing any useful work. These processes are not in the waiting state, and they are running concurrently. This is different from a deadlock because in a deadlock all processes are in the waiting state.
     
3. [What is a Resource Starvation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01DiVzZbRjY)<br>
    Starvation is a problem which is closely related to both, Livelock and Deadlock. In a dynamic system, requests for resources keep on happening. Thereby, some policy is needed to make a decision about who gets the resource when. This process, being reasonable, may lead to a some processes never getting serviced even though they are not deadlocked. Starvation happens when “greedy” threads make shared resources unavailable for long periods.

4. [What is a Critical Section?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlGcP-JNxXk)<br>
    The critical section is a code segment where the shared variables can be accessed. An atomic action is required in a critical section i.e. only one process can execute in its critical section at a time


5. [What is a Semaphore?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2ujg5K310s)<br>
    A semaphore is a signaling mechanism and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. This is different than a mutex as the mutex can be signaled only by the thread that called the wait function.

    A semaphore uses two atomic operations, wait and signal for process synchronization. A Semaphore is an integer variable, which can be accessed only through two operations wait() and signal().

    There are two types of semaphores: Binary Semaphores and Counting Semaphores

    - Binary Semaphores: They can only be either 0 or 1. They are also known as mutex locks, as the locks can provide mutual exclusion. All the processes can share the same mutex semaphore that is initialized to 1. Then, a process has to wait until the lock becomes 0. Then, the process can make the mutex semaphore 1 and start its critical section. When it completes its critical section, it can reset the value of mutex semaphore to 0 and some other process can enter its critical section.
    
    - Counting Semaphores: They can have any value and are not restricted over a certain domain. They can be used to control access to a resource that has a limitation on the number of simultaneous accesses. The semaphore can be initialized to the number of instances of the resource. Whenever a process wants to use that resource, it checks if the number of remaining instances is more than zero, i.e., the process has an instance available. Then, the process can enter its critical section thereby decreasing the value of the counting semaphore by 1. After the process is over with the use of the instance of the resource, it can leave the critical section thereby adding 1 to the number of available instances of the resource.

6. [Race condition in Process Synchronization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aF0q7NfwfA)<br>
    When more than one processes are executing the same code or accessing the same memory or any shared variable in that condition there is a possibility that the output or the value of the shared variable is wrong so for that all the processes doing the race to say that my output is correct this condition known as a race condition. Several processes access and process the manipulations over the same data concurrently, then the outcome depends on the particular order in which the access takes place.
    A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when the result of multiple thread execution in the critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute.

7. [About Atomic Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn1GEmBsPmQ)<br>
    Atomic operations in concurrent programming are program operations that run completely independently of any other processes. Atomic operations are used in many modern operating systems and parallel processing systems.

8. [What is a mutex?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lAuS6jsDgE)<br>
    In computer science, a lock or mutex is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.
    
9. [Mutex vs Semaphore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF3AsTglUU)<br>
    A mutex is locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task (can be a thread or process based on OS abstraction) can acquire the mutex. It means there is ownership associated with mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex).

    Semaphore is signaling mechanism (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal). For example, if you are listening songs (assume it as one task) on your mobile and at the same time your friend calls you, an interrupt is triggered upon which an interrupt service routine (ISR) signals the call processing task to wakeup.

10. [Recovering from a deadlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQBt1IYMscI)<br>
    A traditional operating system such as Windows doesn’t deal with deadlock recovery as it is time and space consuming process. Real-time operating systems use Deadlock recovery.

    Recovery method
    
    - Killing the process: killing all the process involved in the deadlock. Killing process one by one. After killing each process check for deadlock again keep repeating the process till system recover from deadlock.
    
    - Resource Preemption: Resources are preempted from the processes involved in the deadlock, preempted resources are allocated to other processes so that there is a possibility of recovering the system from deadlock. In this case, the system goes into starvation.
