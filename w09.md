# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [What is BIOS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncUmWthHrU0)<br>
    Basic Input/Output System 

    In computing, BIOS is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on.
    
2. [What is Systemd?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtEqbYTLHfs)<br>
    Systemd is a Linux initialization system and service manager that includes features like on-demand starting of daemons, mount and automount point maintenance, snapshot support, and processes tracking using Linux control groups. systemd provides a logging daemon and other tools and utilities to help with common system administration tasks.

    Systemd provides a standard process for controlling what programs run when a Linux system boots up. While systemd is compatible with SysV and Linux Standard Base (LSB) init scripts, systemd is meant to be a drop-in replacement for these older ways of getting a Linux system running.
    
3. [What is UEFI?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Mw3ryJAN8)<br>
   Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification for a software program that connects a computer's firmware to its operating system (OS). UEFI is expected to eventually replace BIOS. Like BIOS, UEFI is installed at the time of manufacturing and is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on.

4. [Difference Between UEFI and BIOS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIYkol851dU)<br>

    - UEFI enables users to handle drives that are larger than 2 TB, while the old legacy BIOS couldn't handle large storage drives.

    - UEFI supports more than 4 primary partitions with a GUID Partition Table.

    - Computers who use UEFI firmware have faster booting process than the BIOS. Various optimizations and enhancement in the UEFI can help your system boot more quickly than it could before.
    
    
5. [What is a Bootloader?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tXox11ngLY)<br>
    A bootloader, also known as a boot program or bootstrap loader, is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a bootloader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computer’s firmware (e.g. BIOS) about where the bootloader is. The whole process is also described as “booting”.
    
6. [Bootloaders in Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hyCLMht70)<br>
    - GNU GRUB : GRUB is extremely easy to install and setup, often requiring only two standard commands. This Linux bootloader is very much filesystem aware and can detect kernel files even without a specified logical sector.
    GRUB has in-built support for UEFI mainboards, secondary hard-disk drives, most Windows systems, and multiboot.
    It supports numerous filesystems including but not limited to ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, zfs, minix, iso9660, xfs, NTFS, and FAT32.

    - rEFInd : rEFInd comes with default support for launching legacy BIOS boot loaders on UEFI machines with CSM support. This bootloader allows users to customize the fonts, icons, and backgrounds of their themes as they like. It provides users the ability to set OS-specific boost options and includes ready-made drivers for the Linux ReiserFS and ext2 filesystems. rEFInd is written using the C programming language and is immensely lightweight at only 4 MB.
   
    - Clover Bootloader : Clover comes with native support for widescreen GUI and allows users to run EFI commands from the GUI directly. It features stunning themes and icons alongside the ability to customize each component based on the user’s taste. Clover Bootloader offers a wide range of convenient keyboard shortcuts, which makes it extremely easy to administer. Users can directly boot using UEFI firmware or via the CloverEFI firmware emulation.

7. [What is a firmware?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YfZcNUhBKY&t=105s)<br>
    Firmware is the low-level software operating the hardware of a microprocessor- or microcontroller-based device. It enables components to interact with each other and implements communications protocols, among other tasks.

    Firmware, which is added at the time of manufacturing, is used to run user programs on the device and can be thought of as the software that allows hardware to run.

    Examples of firmware include:
    - The BIOS found in IBM-compatible Personal Computers.
    - Code inside a printer (in addition to the printer driver that is on the computer)
    - Software controlling a heart defibrillator.
    - Software controlling the lights in an office building.
    

8. [What is RAID?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa0RTgxJJy8)<br>
    RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. That means that RAID is a way of logically putting multiple disks together into a single array. The idea then is that these disks working together will have the speed and/or reliability of a more expensive disk. It allows us to store data across multiple hard drives. The purpose of RAID is to achieve data redundancy to reduce data loss and, in a lot of cases, improve performance.

9. [What is NAS (Network Attached Storage)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yZDDr0JKVc)<br>
    Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables multiple users and heterogeneous client devices to retrieve data from centralized disk capacity. Users on a local area network (LAN) access the shared storage via a standard Ethernet connection.

10. [What is Disk Partitioning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUM4kR67XQ)<br>
    Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can be managed separately. These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed disk, before any file system is created.

    Partitioning a disk can make it easier to organize files, such as video and photo libraries, especially if you have a large hard drive. Creating a separate partition for your system files (the startup disk) can also help protect system data from corruption since each partition has its own file system.

    Partitions are necessary because you can't just start writing files to a blank drive. You must first create at least one container with a file system. We call this container a partition. You can have one partition that contains all the storage space on the drive or divide the space into twenty different partitions.
