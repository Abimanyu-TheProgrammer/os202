# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Reverse Engineering](https://hackersonlineclub.com/reverse-engineering/)<br>
    Reverse Engineering (RE) is the decompilation of an application, regardless of the programming language that was used to create it, so that one can obtain its source code or any part of it.

    What decompilation of an application means is reverting a compiled code back into the language it was written in (eg. Java, C++, Python), the reason behind this is because compiled code is unreadable, only 0s and 1s.

    Reverse-engineering is used for many purposes: as a learning tool; as a way to make new, compatible products that are cheaper than what’s currently on the market; for making software interoperate more effectively or to bridge data between different operating systems or databases; and to uncover the undocumented features of commercial products.

    Reverse-engineering can also expose security flaws and questionable privacy practice.



2. [Cryptography](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-cryptography.html)<br>
    Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries, the ones who will try to obtain the secret message. In a nutshell, encrypting a message to prevent other parties from being able to read it.

    Encryption of a message uses an algorithm and a key to transform an input (i.e., plaintext) into an encrypted output (i.e., ciphertext). A given algorithm will always transform the same plaintext into the same ciphertext if the same key is used.

    There are two kinds of cryptography :<br>

    Symmetric cryptography : the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.<br>
    Asymmetric cryptography : two different keys are used for encryption and decryption<br>

    How it works:<br> 

    Data encrypted with a public key may only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. So, sending a message to John requires encrypting that message with John’s public key. Only John can decrypt the message, as only John has his private key. Any data encrypted with a private key can only be decrypted with the corresponding public key. Similarly, Jane could digitally sign a message with her private key, and anyone with Jane’s public key could decrypt the signed message and verify that it was in fact Jane who sent it.



3. [Web Exploitation](https://www.opensourceforu.com/2012/03/cyber-attacks-explained-web-exploitation/)<br>
    Web exploitation focuses on web vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit them. These are some of the most common yet dangerous attacks

    DoS and sniffing<br>
    Since the website is hosted on an IP address open to the Internet, a denial of service attack can easily take the Web server down. Similarly, packet sniffing can easily be used to capture plain-text user IDs and passwords on the wire, if encryption or other security measures are not put in place during Web designing. Almost all Layer 2 and 3 attacks such as packet flooding, SYN flooding, etc, are possible on a website IP and the port on which it is hosted.

    Session hijacking<br>
    A Web server talks to multiple browsers at the same time, to  take requests in and to deliver the requested content. While each connection is made, the Web server needs to have a way to maintain the uniqueness for each connection. It uses session tokens for this — dynamically generated text strings, which are factors of an IP address, the date, time, etc.

    Attackers can steal this token either by guessing programmatically or sniffing on the network, or by performing a client-side script attack on a victim computer. Once stolen, this token can be used to create a fake Web request and steal the victim user’s session and information.

    Cross-site scripting<br>
    This is the most common vulnerability in Web technology, attracting XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks on all major and famous websites. It has been found that a large number of websites are vulnerable to this attack, even today. This vulnerability is a result of improper programming practices and the unavailability of appropriate security measures in a Web infrastructure.

    As we know, a client browser maintains its own security in terms of not allowing website contents and the website cookies to be accessed by anyone, except by the users themselves. In this case, the vulnerabilities in a Web application let crackers inject client-side code into the page accessed by users. This code is typically written using JavaScript.

    To understand this, consider a page that takes the user name as input, and writes back on the screen “Welcome username”. Let us then suppose the input box is filled up with JavaScript instead, such as what follows:

    "<script> alert ('You are in trouble') </script>"
    Here, the Web page may end up executing the script tags, showing the dialogue box message “You are in trouble”. This can be further exploited by the attacker, by simply poisoning the cookie, stealing the session and injecting this code into the victim user’s browser. Upon doing so, the JavaScript code would run in the victim’s browser, and create damage to any extent possible.

4. [7 Layers of Cybersecurity Threats](https://training.nhlearninggroup.com/blog/7-layers-of-cybersecurity-threats-in-the-iso-osi-model)<br>

    Layer 7 : Application Layer Threats<br>
    Example of Application Layer Threats include denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) attacks, HTTP floods, SQL injections, cross-site scripting, parameter tampering, and Slowloris attacks.

    Explanation of a Slowloris attack [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiFkyR35v2Y)

    Explanation of a DDOS attack [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I4O4hoKzb8)

    Explanation of Parameter Tampering [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zjAv_BBDUQ)

    Layer 6 : Presentation Layer Threats<br>
    The most prevalent threats at this layer are malformed SSL requests. Knowing that inspecting SSL encryption packets is resource intensive, attackers use SSL to tunnel HTTP attacks to target the server.

    Layer 5 : Session Layer threats<br>
    DDoS-attackers exploit a flaw in a Telnet server running on the switch, rendering Telnet services unavailable.

    At layer 5-7, we are looking primarily at application level attacks which result from poor coding practices. Vulnerabilities in applications can be exploited through attacks such as SQL injection, where the developer has failed to ensure that user input is validated against a defined schema.

    Layer 4 : Transport Layer Threats<br>
    Layer 4 is the transport layer and utilises common transport protocols to enable network communications. This may include the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and Universal Data Protocol (UDP).

    Port scanning, a method by which to identify vulnerable or open network ports, operates at layer 4 of the OSI model. Implementing effective firewalls and locking down ports only to those required can mitigate risks at this level.

    Layer 3 : Network Layer Threats<br>
    Routers make decisions based on layer 3 information, so the most common network layer threats are generally router-related, including information gathering, sniffing, spoofing, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in which multiple hosts are enlisted to bombard a target router with requests to the point where it gets overloaded and cannot accept genuine requests.

    Layer 2 : Data Link Layer<br>
    Layer 2 of the OSI model is the data link layer and focuses on the methods for delivering data blocks. Normally, this consists of switches utilising protocols such as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which is used throughout networking for dynamic IP assignment.

    Attacks at this layer can focus on the insecurity of the protocols used or the lack of hardening on the routing devices themselves. As switches focus is on providing LAN connectivity, the majority of threats come from inside the organisation itself. Layer 2 attacks may also include MAC flooding or ARP poisoning.

    Layer 1 : Physical Layer<br>
    Layer 1 refers to the physical aspect of networking – in other words, the cabling and infrastructure used for networks to communicate. Layer 1 attacks focus on disrupting this service in any manner possible, primarily resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This disruption could be caused by physically cutting cable right through to disrupting wireless signals.


5. [Digital Forensics](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/computer-forensics)<br>

    Computer forensics is the application of investigation and analysis techniques to gather and preserve evidence from a particular computing device in a way that is suitable for presentation in a court of law. The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation while maintaining a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it.

6. [Binary Exploitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akCce7vSSfw)<br>
    Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to you, the attacker.

7. [How Does a VPN Work?](https://www.namecheap.com/vpn/how-does-vpn-virtual-private-network-work/#:~:text=A%20VPN%20works%20by%20routing,VPN%20rather%20than%20your%20computer.)<br>

    VPN (Virtual Private Network) works by routing your device’s internet connection through your chosen VPN’s private server rather than your internet service provider (ISP) so that when your data is transmitted to the internet, it comes from the VPN rather than your computer. The VPN acts as an intermediary of sorts as you connect to the internet, thereby hiding your IP address – the string of numbers your ISP assigns your device – and protecting your identity. Furthermore, if your data is somehow intercepted, it will be unreadable until it reaches its final destination.

 
    Most people use this to open blocked sites on the internet. How does that work? We have mentioned that a VPN acts as a hiding layer that doesn't reveal your IP address. While using a VPN, the traffic from your device passes through a VPN server that is not blocked by the government or ISP, hence, allowing you to browse websites.

8. [What Is a Private Search Engine?](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/private-search-engines/#:~:text=Private%20Search%20Engines%20are%20the,to%20keep%20your%20searches%20safe.)<br>

    Private Search Engines are the search engines that do not store your queries or track your steps on the Internet.

    Examples of such browsers can be found [here](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/private-search-engines/#:~:text=Private%20Search%20Engines%20are%20the,to%20keep%20your%20searches%20safe.)

    What is the difference of this and the incognito mode of regular browser's?<br>

    The goal of private browsing is to prevent information from being automatically stored on your device, like browsing histories or downloaded cookies. Though in some instances, files that have been downloaded or bookmarked may still be saved. Then, the private browsing session expires only when the browser window is closed.

    The issue remains: Your activity may still be visible to the Internet service provider, as well as to the organization that provides the Internet connection, such as a school, college, or company. Also, the websites you visit may be able to view your session.

9. [Details of wget Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
    Wget is a computer tool created by the GNU Project. You can use it to retrieve content and files from various web servers. The name is a combination of World Wide Web and the word get. It supports downloads via FTP, SFTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.

    Wget is created in portable C and usable on any Unix system. It’s also possible to implement on Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, AmigaOS, and other popular platforms.


10. [What is a Kernel?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))<br>
    Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of memory and CPU time. It is core component of an operating system. Kernel acts as a bridge between applications and data processing performed at hardware level using inter-process communication and system calls.

    Objectives of Kernel :<br>

    To establish communication between user level application and hardware.<br>
    To decide state of incoming processes.<br>
    To control disk management.<br>
    To control memory management.<br>
    To control task management.<br>
