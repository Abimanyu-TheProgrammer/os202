# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [What is a GnuPG Key Pair?](https://gnupg.org/)<br>
    GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) Key Pair, aka GPG, is a tool for secure communication. GnuPG uses public-key cryptography so that users may communicate securely. In a public-key system, each user has a pair of keys consisting of a private key and a public key. A user's private key is kept secret; it need never be revealed. The public key may be given to anyone with whom the user wants to communicate. Aside from the public and private keys, we can also generate a revocation certificate, which is used to revoke your public/private keypair when your private key is compromised or you forget the passphrase for your private key. GnuPG has been proven to be unhackable in the real world and is used by companies worldwide to encrypt sensitive information so only the encryptor and recipient can read the data.

    Relation between GPG and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):<br>
    These are two different computer programs developed to protect electronic communications. Today almost everyone uses emails for correspondence and communication, but this medium is not as secure as we think it is. The emails can easily be forged by someone using anybody’s name or identity, and the emails can easily be stored and read by people with special skills. To solve these existing problems and improving the security of emails as well as making them more private, these two programs were developed and used. The privacy of emails is maintained by these programs because they allow encryption of messages by people, and only the people who are authorized can read the encrypted messages; secondly, they are difficult to forge.

    PGP is written by Phil Zimmerman. It uses the RSA and IDEA encryption algorithm and because of this, it is not free.
    GPG is a re-write of PGP. It does not use the IDEA encryption algorithm, instead it uses NIST AES, Advanced Encryption Standard, therefore it's free.

    Terms regarding GnuPG:<br>
    signing : A digital signature certifies and timestamps a document. If the document is subsequently modified in any way, a verification of the signature will fail. The GnuPG source distribution, for example, is signed so that users can verify that the source code has not been modified since it was packaged.

2. [What is a Masquerade Attack?](https://cyware.com/news/masquerade-attack-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing-93393863)<br>
    Masquerade Attack in a nutshell, is pretending to be someone to get unauthorized access to something. 

    How it's usually done :<br>
    In Masquerade attacks, attackers send phishing emails to targets posing as legitimate organizations and requesting victims to submit their personal information.<br><br>
    Attackers also steal users’ login credentials and gain unauthorized privileges to access confidential files in an computer by masquerading the user.

    An example : <br>
    Researchers observed tax-themed phishing campaigns that impersonated legitimate tax authorities such as the US Internal Revenue Service, Canada Revenue Agency, and the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department. These phishing emails included HTML attachments or URLs, which upon clicking opened an online form or redirected victims to a spoofed IRS login page. The online form asks for victims’ financial information, while the login page collects victims’ login credentials. After which, victims are redirected to the official tax authority websites.

    Ways to stay protected:<br>
    Researchers recommend users to never open emails or attachments that come from anonymous senders.<br>
    If the email purports to come from legitimate sources then it is recommended to ensure the sender’s email address and confirm directly with the sender in person or via phone call regarding the email.<br>
    To stay protected from such attacks, it is always recommended to use strong, complex, lengthy, and unique passwords that are difficult to crack.<br>

3. [What is a Replay Attack?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReplay_attack&psig=AOvVaw16B5Pz3YWSjXxZhZxjrinc&ust=1601903787694000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCJjexeGCm-wCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)<br>
    A replay attack (also known as playback attack) is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. The delay or repeat of the data transmission is carried out by the sender or by the malicious entity, who intercepts the data and retransmits it. Encrypted messages have "keys" within them. At the end of a transmission, the key can be used to decrypt the message, which then can be opened. In a replay attack, it doesn't matter if the attacker can read the message or decipher the key. All he or she has to do is capture and resend the entire thing — message and key — together.

    How it's done :<br>
    A staff member at a company asks for a financial transfer by sending an encrypted message to the company's financial administrator. An attacker eavesdrops on this message, captures it, and is now in a position to resend it. Because it's an authentic message that has simply been resent, the message is already correctly encrypted and looks legitimate to the financial administrator.

    In this scenario, the financial administrator is likely to respond to this new request unless he or she has a good reason to be suspicious. That response could include sending a large sum of money to the attacker's bank account.

    Ways to stay protected:<br>
    Both sender and receiver should establish a completely random session key, which is a type of code that is only valid for one transaction and can't be used again.<br>
    Another preventative measure for this type of attack is using timestamps on all messages. This prevents hackers from resending messages sent longer ago than a certain length of time, thus reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop, siphon off the message, and resend it.

4. [What is a Human-in-the-middle attack (Man-in-the-middle attack)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1pcOfrTXc)<br>
    A good illustration of a Man-in-the-middle attack:[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1pcOfrTXc)

    A man-in-the-middle attack requires three players. There’s the victim, the entity with which the victim is trying to communicate, and the “man in the middle,” who’s intercepting the victim’s communications. Critical to the scenario is that the victim isn’t aware of the man in the middle.

    How it's done : <br>
    Let’s say you received an email that appeared to be from your bank, asking you to log in to your account to confirm your contact information. You click on a link in the email and are taken to what appears to be your bank’s website, where you log in and perform the requested task.

    In such a scenario, the man in the middle (MITM) sent you the email, making it appear to be legitimate. (This attack also involves phishing, getting you to click on the email appearing to come from your bank.) He also created a website that looks just like your bank’s website, so you wouldn’t hesitate to enter your login credentials after clicking the link in the email. But when you do that, you’re not logging into your bank account, you’re handing over your credentials to the attacker.

    More about it:[Link](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-wifi-what-is-a-man-in-the-middle-attack.html)

    Ways to stay protected:<br>
    Be wary of links that you click to avoid phishing attempts that lead to MiTM attacks.<br>
    Keep your operating system and your browser always up to date. This way, the attackers will not be able to use exploits to install malware on your computer.<br>
    Use a secure WiFi protocol on your router (WPA2, WPA3 if available), use a secure WiFi key, change default login credentials for your router and update your router firmware. This way, attackers won’t be able to compromise your local area network.<br>
    Limit your sensitive activity on public networks or use a VPN connection on public networks. A VPN will add an extra layer of security.<br>

5. [What is Session Hijacking?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1QEs3mdJoc&vl=tr)<br>
    A good explanation of Session Hijacking:[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1QEs3mdJoc&vl=tr)

    In computer science, session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. Session hijacking most commonly applies to browser sessions and web applications.

    How it's done:
    In most cases when you log into a web application, the server sets a temporary session cookie in your browser to remember that you are currently logged in and authenticated. HTTP is a stateless protocol and session cookies attached to every HTTP header are the most popular way for the server to identify your browser or your current session.

    To perform session hijacking, an attacker needs to know the victim’s session ID (session key). This can be obtained by stealing the session cookie or persuading the user to click a malicious link containing a prepared session ID (in the computerphile video, he used XSS). In both cases, after the user is authenticated on the server, the attacker can take over (hijack) the session by using the same session ID for their own browser session. The server is then fooled into treating the attacker’s connection as the original user’s valid session.

    To go in detail of the methods used in session hijacking, go to this link:[Link](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/session-hijacking/#:~:text=Session%20hijacking%20is%20an%20attack,ends%20when%20you%20log%20out.)

    After a session is hijacked by the attacker, he or she can access your shopping cart for example, or worse your credit card details and address.

    Ways to stay protected: <br>
    Web frameworks offer highly secure and well-tested session ID generation and management mechanisms. Use them instead of inventing your own session management.<br>
    Regenerate the session key after initial authentication. This causes the session key to change immediately after authentication, which nullifies session fixation attacks – even if the attacker knows the initial session ID, it becomes useless before it can be used.<br>
    Perform additional user identity verification beyond the session key. This means using not just cookies, but also other checks, such as the user’s usual IP address or application usage patterns. The downside of this approach is that any false alarms can be inconvenient or annoying to legitimate users. A common additional safeguard is a user inactivity timeout to close the user session after a set idle time.

6. [What is Privilege escalation?](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/privilege-escalation/)<br>
    Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. They can then access the functionality and data of another user (horizontal privilege escalation) or obtain elevated privileges, typically of a system administrator or other power user (vertical privilege escalation).

    With horizontal privilege escalation, the attacker remains on the same level of user privilege but able to access the functionality of other users that are on that level. For example, in an e-commerce platform, an attacker can gain access to another user's profile, or bank account in an e-banking website.

    More dangerous is vertical privilege escalation, in which the attacker starts off as a regular user then gains permitted access to functionalities that are of an administrator. The attacker then does all sorts of things like stealing access credentials and other sensitive information, downloading and executing malware, erasing data, or executing arbitrary code. Also with this privileges, the attacker can cover their tracks by erasing the logs of their activities.

    How it's done:<br>
    Privilege escalation can happen because of cross-site scripting, improper cookie handling, and weak passwords. 

    Ways to stay protected: <br>
    Passwords need to be strong enough to be secure.<br>
    Create specialized users and groups with minimum necessary privileges and file access.<br>
    Secure your databases and sanitize user input.

7. [What is a Malware?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)<br>
    Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.

    Some types of Malware in points 8 to 10

8. [What is a Trojan Horse?](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-trojan.html)<br>
    In computing, a Trojan horse, or trojan, is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy. 

    It is basically a malicious code or software, that looks legit, but is written to do damage to your data or computer. A Trojan is sometimes called a Trojan virus or a Trojan horse virus, but that’s a misnomer. Viruses can execute and replicate themselves. A Trojan cannot. A user has to execute Trojans. Even so, Trojan malware and Trojan virus are often used interchangeably.

    How it works: <br>
    You might think you’ve received an email from someone you know and click on what looks like a legitimate attachment. But you’ve been fooled. The email is from a cybercriminal, and the file you clicked on — and downloaded and opened — has gone on to install malware on your device.

    When you execute the program, the malware can spread to other files and damage your computer.

    How? It varies. Trojans are designed to do different things. But you’ll probably wish they weren’t doing any of them on your device.

9. [What is a Ransomware?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware)<br>
    Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

    How it works: <br>
    Ransomware enters your network in a variety of ways, the most popular is a download via a spam email attachment. The download then launches the ransomware program that attacks your system. Other forms of entry include social engineering (baiting), downloads of the malicious software from the web that can be direct from a site or by clicking on “malvertising,” fake ads that unleash the ransomware. The malware can also be spread through chat messages or even removable USB drives.

10. [What is an Adware?](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware/)<br>
    Adware (Advertising-supported software) is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser. Some security professionals view it as the forerunner of the modern-day PUP (potentially unwanted program).

    How it works: <br>
    There are two main ways an adware can enter your system. The first one, is the case when you download a software and it istalls adware without your knowledge.<br>
    The second way would be when you're visiting a website, which could be infected with an adware. It takes advantage of your vulnerable web browser to deliver a drive-by download (an uninteded download of one or more files without the user's consent.). After the adware is downloaded, it searches for personal information to filter ads that will be shown then redirects you to malicious websites.
