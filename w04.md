# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Logical vs Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/#:~:text=The%20basic%20difference%20between%20Logical,exists%20in%20the%20memory%20unit.)<br>
    An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical address,
    whereas an address seen by the memory unit—that is, the one loaded into
    the memory-address register of the memory—is commonly referred to as a
    physical address.

2. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html#:~:text=Memory%20allocation%20is%20the%20process,of%20a%20structure%20or%20class.)<br>
    Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes.

    There are two types of memory allocation
    - Static Memory Allocation
    - Dynamic Memory Allocation

    Explanation about them [here](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html#:~:text=Memory%20allocation%20is%20the%20process,of%20a%20structure%20or%20class.)

    Contigous and Non-Contigous Memory Allocation:<br>
    Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method in which a single contiguous section/part of memory is allocated to a process or file needing it. Because of this all the available memory space resides at the same place together, which means that the freely/unused available memory partitions are not distributed in a random fashion here and there across the whole memory space.

    Non-Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method on the contrary to contiguous allocation method, allocates the memory space present in different locations to the process as per it’s requirements. As all the available memory space is in a distributed pattern so the freely available memory space is also scattered here and there.
    This technique of memory allocation helps to reduce the wastage of memory, which eventually gives rise to Internal and external fragmentation.

3. [Paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging)<br>
    Paging is a memory management scheme that permits a process’s physical address space to be noncontiguous.
    Paging avoids external fragmentation and the associated need for compaction, two problems that plague contiguous memory allocation. Paging is implemented through cooperation between the operating system and
    the computer hardware. The basic method for implementing paging involves breaking physical memory
    into fixed-sized blocks called frames and breaking logical memory into
    blocks of the same size called pages.When a process is to be executed, its pages
    are loaded into any available memory frames from their source (a file system or
    the backing store). Source: Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz Ch.9

4. [File System](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5510/file-system#:~:text=A%20file%20system%20is%20a,abstract%20to%20a%20human%20user.)<br>
    A file system is a process that manages how and where data on a storage disk, typically a hard disk drive (HDD), is stored, accessed and managed. It is a logical disk component that manages a disk's internal operations as it relates to a computer and is abstract to a human user. A general-purpose computer system can have multiple storage devices, and those devices can be sliced up into partitions, which hold volumes which in turn hold file systems. Depending on the volume manager, a volume may span multiple partitions as well.

5. [Memory Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection)<br>
    Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it.

    Memory protection in a paged environment is accomplished by protection bits
    associated with each frame. Normally, these bits are kept in the page table.
    One bit can define a page to be read–write or read-only. Every reference
    to memory goes through the page table to find the correct frame number. At
    the same time that the physical address is being computed, the protection bits
    can be checked to verify that no writes are being made to a read-only page. An
    attempt to write to a read-only page causes a hardware trap to the operating
    system (or memory-protection violation).

6. [Shared Library](http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/tools/ShLib_WhatIs.html#:~:text=A%20shared%20library%20is%20a,Instead%2C%20a%20special%20section%20called%20.)<br>
    The concept of a shared library is enabling programs to use <i>common code</i>. A shared library is a file containing object code that several a.out files may use simultaneously while executing. When a program is link edited with a shared library, the library code that defines the program's external references is not copied into the program's object file. Instead, a special section called .lib that identifies the library code is created in the object file. When the UNIX system executes the resulting a.out file, it uses the information in this section to bring the required shared library code into the address space of the process.

    A simple example of this would be the shared C library. Shared libraries are linked into the program in two stages. First, during compile time, the linker verifies that all the symbols (functions, variables and the like) required by the program, are either linked into the program, or in one of its shared libraries. However, the object files from the shared library are not inserted into the executable file. Instead, when the program is started, a program in the system (called a dynamic loader) checks out which shared libraries were linked with the program, loads them to memory, and attaches them to the copy of the program in memory.


7. [C Language](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)<br>
    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
    

8. [DIfference between C and C++](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-c-and-cplusplus)<br>
    The main difference between both these languages is C is a procedural programming language and does not support classes and objects, while C++ is a combination of both procedural and object-oriented programming languages.
    Detailed explanation about it [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-c-and-cplusplus)

    

9. [C# Language](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/)<br>
    C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. 


10. [Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)<br>
    A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The difference between a pointer and a ordinary variable is that ordinary variables hold values of their type while pointers always hold addresses.
