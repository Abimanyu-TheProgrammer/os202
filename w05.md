# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory#:~:text=Virtual%20memory%20is%20a%20very,(RAM)%20to%20disk%20storage.)<br>
    Virtual memory is a very common technique used in the operating systems (OS) of computers. Virtual memory uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.

    In short : using the HDD as a RAM.
2. [Demand Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
    The process of loading the page into memory on demand (whenever page fault occurs) is known as demand paging. - GeeksforGeeks

    Definition of page fault : A page fault (sometimes called #PF, PF or hard fault) is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a process. Source [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault)

    Pages are loaded only when they are <b><i>demanded</i></b> during program execution. - OSC Ch.10 Pg.505

    In my language : Demand paging is a process of loading a page into memory, only when it is needed but not to be found (page fault).

    With Demand paging, memory is used more efficiently because only the portions of programs that are needed. In the extreme case, we can start executing a process with no pages in memory. When the operating system sets the instruction pointer to the first instruction of the process, which is on a non-memory-resident page, the process immediately faults for the page. After this page is brought into memory, the process continues to execute, faulting as necessary until every page that it needs is in memory. At that point, it can execute with no more faults. This scheme is pure demand paging: never bring a page into memory until it is required. Theoretically, some programs could access several new pages of memory with each instruction execution (one page for the instruction and many for data), possibly causing multiple page faults per instruction. This situation would result in unacceptable system performance. Fortunately, analysis of running processes shows that this behavior is exceedingly unlikely. Programs tend to have locality of reference, described in Section 10.6.1, which results in reasonable performance from demand paging.

3. [Copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)<br>
    Copy-on-write (COW), sometimes referred to as implicit sharing or shadowing, is a resource-management technique used in computer programming to efficiently implement a "duplicate" or "copy" operation on modifiable resources. If a resource is duplicated but not modified, it is not necessary to create a new resource; the resource can be shared between the copy and the original. Modifications must still create a copy, hence the technique: the copy operation is deferred until the first write. By sharing resources in this way, it is possible to significantly reduce the resource consumption of unmodified copies, while adding a small overhead to resource-modifying operations. - Wikipedia

    Copy-on-write works by allowing the parent and child processes initially to share the same pages. These shared pages are marked as copy-on-write pages, meaning that if either process writes to a shared page, a copy of the shared page is created. - OSC Ch.10 Pg 511

     

4. [Page Replacement]()<br>
    In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. - Wikipedia

    Page replacement is a process of swapping out an existing page from the frame of a main memory and replacing it with the required page. All the frames of main memory are already occupied. Source [here](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/page-replacement-algorithms-page-fault/#:~:text=Page%20replacement%20is%20a%20process,it%20with%20the%20required%20page.&text=All%20the%20frames%20of%20main%20memory%20are%20already%20occupied.,-Thus%2C%20a%20page)

    Page replacement takes the following approach. If no frame is free, we find one that is not currently being used and free it. We can free a frame by writing its contents to swap space and changing the page table (and all other tables) to indicate that the page is no longer in memory - OSC Ch.10 Pg.514

    Basically it's a process to find out which page to replace (because it is not used) to get another page that is needed for computation. In this context, the page table is full.



5. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.google.com/search?q=allocation+of+frames+in+os&oq=allocation+of+frames&aqs=chrome.0.0i457j69i57j0l4.6714j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)<br>
    Difference between a page and a frame : 
    - A page in a paging system is a virtual memory block with a fixed length. But a frame in a paging system is a main memory block with fixed length.
    - A page has virtual address and it is transferred as a unit between main memory and secondary memory. But a frame can only hold one page of virtual memory.

    Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. Frame allocation algorithms can be found [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=allocation+of+frames+in+os&oq=allocation+of+frames&aqs=chrome.0.0i457j69i57j0l4.6714j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


    

6. [Thrasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science))<br>
    Consider what occurs if a process does not have “enough” frames— that is, it does not have the minimum number of frames it needs to support pages in the working set. The process will quickly page-fault. At this point, it must replace some page. However, since all its pages are in active use, it must replace a page that will be needed again right away. Consequently, it quickly faults again, and again, and again, replacing pages that it must bring back in immediately. This high paging activity is called thrashing. A process is thrashing if it is spending more time paging than executing. As you might expect, thrashing results in severe performance problems. OSC Ch.10 Pg.531

    n computer science, thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most application-level processing. This causes the performance of the computer to degrade or collapse. - Wikipedia


7. [Memory Compression](https://www.howtogeek.com/319933/what-is-memory-compression-in-windows-10/)<br>
    
    Virtual memory compression (also referred to as RAM compression and memory compression) is a memory management technique that utilizes data compression to reduce the size or number of paging requests to and from the auxiliary storage. -Wikipedia

    Here, rather than paging out modified frames to swap space, we compress several frames into a single frame, enabling the system to reduce memory usage without resorting to swapping pages. - OSC Ch.10 Pg.537

8. [Allocating Kernel Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/#:~:text=A%20second%20strategy%20for%20allocating,objects%20of%20the%20same%20type.)<br>
    Definition of Kernel : The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system. It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory". It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of startup as well as input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers. -Wikipedia

    Strategies for allocating Kernel can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/#:~:text=A%20second%20strategy%20for%20allocating,objects%20of%20the%20same%20type.)
    

9. [Considerations for replacement algorithms and an allocation policy]()<br>
    - Prepaging
    An obvious property of pure demand paging is the large number of page faults that occur when a process is started. This situation results from trying to get the initial locality into memory. Prepaging is an attempt to prevent this high level of initial paging. The strategy is to bring some—or all—of the pages that will be needed into memory at one time.

    - Page Size
    The designers of an operating system for an existing machine seldom have a choice concerning the page size. However, when new machines are being designed, a decision regarding the best page size must be made. As you might expect, there is no single best page size. Rather, there is a set of factors that support various sizes. Page sizes are invariably powers of 2, generally ranging from 4,096 (2^12) to 4,194,304 (2^22) bytes. One concern is the size of the page table. For a given virtual memory space, decreasing the page size increases the number of pages and hence the size of the page table. For a virtual memory of 4 MB (222), for example, there would be 4,096 pages of 1,024 bytes but only 512 pages of 8,192 bytes. Because each active process must have its own copy of the page table, a large page size is desirable.

10. [Some examples of virtual memory in some OS]()<br>
    - Linux
    Linux uses demand paging, allocating pages from a list of free frames. To manage memory, Linux maintains two types of page lists: an active list and an inactive list. The active list contains the pages that are considered in use, while the inactive list contains pages that have not recently been referenced and are eligible to be reclaimed.

    - Windows
    Windows 10 supports 32- and 64-bit systems running on Intel (IA-32 and x86-64) and ARM architectures. On 32-bit systems, the default virtual address space of a process is 2 GB, although it can be extended to 3 GB. 32-bit systems support 4 GB of physical memory. On 64-bit systems, Windows 10 has a 128-TB virtual address space and supports up to 24 TB of physical memory. (Versions of Windows Server support up to 128 TB of physical memory.) Windows 10 implements most of the memory-management features described thus far, including shared libraries, demand paging, copy-on-write, paging, and memory compression. Windows 10 implements virtual memory using demand paging with clustering, a strategy that recognizes locality of memory references and therefore handles page faults by bringing in not only the faulting page but also several pages immediately preceding and following the faulting page.

    - Solaris
    In Solaris, when a thread incurs a page fault, the kernel assigns a page to the faulting thread from the list of free pages it maintains. Therefore, it is imperative that the kernel keep a sufficient amount of free memory available.
