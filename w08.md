# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWkQl0n0w5M)<br>
    In a single-processor system, only one process can run at a time. After a process is done, it typically waits for an I/O request to be completed. During this waiting time, the CPU does nothing. It doesn't take care of the other processes therefore it's wasting time. 

    To combat this, we use a system with multiprogramming, it stores processes in the memory and runs a process when the other has terminated or is waiting for an I/O request. The goal is to maximize cpu utilization. CPU scheduling is a way for the computer to decide which process to be run, for how long, when to run it, etc.
    
2. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=2)<br>
    Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait. Processes alternate between these two states.

    When a process is in the CPU execution state, it is called CPU burst.
    When a process is in the I/O wait state, it is called I/O burst.

    Process execution begins with CPU burst -> I/O burst -> CPU burst -> I/O burst and so on...
    
3. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhFmL-6SDA&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=3)<br>
    Prior knowledge requirements:
    - CPU scheduler = CPU scheduler is the one that decides which process in the memory to be run.
    - Dispatcher = Assigns the CPU to a process. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop a process and start another is called dispatch latency

    Process states explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ_6PXoaoxo&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O)

    CPU scheduling can occur during these events:

    - When a process switches from the running state to the waiting state
    - When a process switches from the running state to the ready state (because of some interrupts)
    - When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state
    - When a process terminates 

    In events first and fourth event, there is no choice but to assign the cpu to a new process because (remember) we want to maximize CPU utilization. In the first event, a process switches from the running to the waiting state, the CPU will idle if we don't assign in to a new process. As for the fourth, it is self explanatory, after one process ends, we must start another. This is called Non-Preemptive Scheduling.

    In the second and third event, there is a choice as to whether we assign the CPU to a new process in the memory or give the CPU to the same process. This is called Preemptive Scheduling.

4. [Scheduling Criteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWHFY8-rL5I&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=4)<br>
    
    - CPU Utilization = How much the CPU is utilized
    - Throughput = The number of process completed per time unit
    - Turnaround Time = The ammount of time it takes for a process to be completed
    - Waiting Time = The ammount of time a process waits in the ready queue
    - Response Time = The ammount of time it takes to start responding

    More about this in the this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWHFY8-rL5I&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=4) 

5. [Scheduling Algorithm - First Come First Served](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DoP1L9nAAs&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=5)<br>

    This is the by far the simplest CPU Scheduling. Whichever process requests the CPU first, will get it first.
    The average waiting time is often quite long however. 
6. [Scheduling Algorithm - Shortest Jobs First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0g9b3SJECg&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=8)<br>
   
   This algorithm considers the shortest time of the next process' CPU burst. So the process with the shortest next CPU burst time will get the CPU. If two processes are a tie, then First-Come, First-Served scheduling is used. This algorithm can either be preemptive or nonpreemptive.

7. [Scheduling Algorithm - Priority Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKD3pcFvGmY&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=11)<br>

    A priority is associated with each process and the CPU is allocated to the one with the highest priority. Equal-priority processes will be resolved with the First-Come, First-Served scheduling.

    The Shortest Jobs First algorithm is essentially Priority Scheduling where the time of the next process' CPU burst determines it's priority. This algorithm, like SJF, can be preemptive or nonpreemptive  

    In preemptive priority scheduling, If a new process has a higher priority than the currently running process, the CPU will be taken away to run that new process first. Else, it will just put a new process in the head of the ready queue to be run.

    One of the problems regarding the priority scheduling is starvation, where high priority processes prevent the low level processes from ever getting the CPU.

8. [Scheduling Algorithm - Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzBBJYfwdi8&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk&index=14)<br>

    This is similiar to the FCFS scheduling, but preemption is added to switch between processes.

    A unit of time is defined, usually called a time quantum or a time slice (generally from 10 to 100 ms). Now with that time slice, the CPU Scheduler will go around the ready queue (here it is treated as a circular queue), giving the CPU to each process for that particular time slice. Whether the burst time of the process is higher or lower than the time slice does not matter.

     

9. [Scheduling Algorithm - Multi-Level Queue Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF3AsTglUU)<br>
   
   The ready queue is partitioned into seperate queues and processes are assigned permanently to one queue based on the property of the process like memory size, priority, execution time, process type, etc.

   <u>Each queue has it's own scheduling algorithm.</u>

   The video explains the implementation of this algorithm with foreground and background processes. 

10. [What is Linux?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA3vmx0GaO8)<br>

    Linux can be installed and used it as a desktop, firewall, a file server, or a web server. Linux allows a user to control every aspect of the operating systems. As Linux is an open-source operating system, it allows a user to modify its source (even source code of applications) itself as per the user requirements.
