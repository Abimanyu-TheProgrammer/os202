# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [One](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
I learned the basics of github

2. [Two](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html)<br>
"An operating system is a software that controls the hardware..."

3. [Three](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/what-is-a-driver-#:~:text=In%20the%20most%20fundamental%20sense,device%20communicate%20with%20each%20other.&text=The%20application%20calls%20a%20function,function%20implemented%20by%20the%20driver.)<br>
"a driver is a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate with each other..."

4. [Four](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading07.htm#:~:text=An%20operating%20system%20has%20three,provide%20services%20for%20applications%20software.)<br>
An operating system has three main functions:<br> 
Manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers<br>
Establish a user interface.<br>
Execute and provide services for applications software.

5. [Five](https://www.smartdraw.com/block-diagram/)<br>
A block diagram is basically a flow chart. It is used in engineering to describe major components, processes and working relationships in a system.<br>
It doesn't show too many details, like the wires or switches. It only gives us an overview of the system so that it is easier to locate the points of interest and trouble spots, therefore block diagrams focuses only on input and output. It doesn't really show what happens in the process between input and output.<br>
A block diagram usually has two components, boxes and lines (drawn with arrows to signify the direction of process). The boxes are the parts in the system, while the lines connecting the boxes show which is the input and the output. 

6. [Six](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/interrupt-handling)<br>
A Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is a part of the CPU that helps it handle interrupt request that may come from multiple different sources (I/O devices) and occurring simultaneously.<br> 
It helps by sorting the interrupts based on the most prioritized so that the CPU executes the most appropriate interrupt handler.<br>
APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is a PIC that is used to extend the number of interrupt requests available, more available interrupt lines, and supports a computer with two or more CPUs


7. [Seven](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/interrupt-handling)<br>
Interrupt handling, from what i remember in ICO, is a process to handle interrupt requests coming from I/O devices, which was from timers and buttons. After an interrupt request is sent, the machine will jump to a specific address to handle that interrupt.

8. [Eight](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/von-neumann-architecture)<br>
The von Neumann architecture in a computer architecture design consists of a Control Unit, ALU, Memory Unit, Registers and Inputs/Outputs. It is based on the stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory, which means instruction fetch and data operation cannot occur simultaneously, because they share a common bus.<br> 
Detailed explanation about buses and the CPU, which consists of the Memory Unit, Control Unit, and a bunch of registers will be provided in the link

9. [Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
Buses, Bridges, Transfer Rate, and Clock.<br>
A bus is a communication system which transfers data between components in a computer, in the form of wires and optic cables.<br>
There are three types of buses :<br><br>
Address bus, which transports the address of data between the processor and memory<br>
Data bus, which transports data between the processor, the memory unit and I/O devices<br>
Control bus, which transports control signals from the CPU to coordinate all of the activities in the computer. Source :

A bridge in computers is related to network. It is a device that connects two LANs.
The difference between a bridge and a router is that bridging connects two smaller networks to create one big network. With routing, the two smaller networks can connect but remain independent.<br>

Three types of bridges that are used in networks:<br>
Transparent bridge : A transparent bridge is invisible to the other devices on the network. Essentially the devices don't know whether these bridges existed or not. It blocks and forwards data based on the MAC address.<br>
Translational bridge : It translates the data it recieves. Translational bridges are used to connect two different networks, such as Ethernet and Token Ring networks.<br>
Source-route bridge : It was designed by IBM for Token Ring networks. A frame (a digital data transmission unit consisting of a header with preamble (start of frame flag), destination and source addresses, data payload, and usually some form of error-checking information) going through this bridge would have the route embedded to it, so this allows the bridge to make specific decisions about how the frame should be forwarded through the network.

Transfer Rate is basically the speed at which information is transferred, measured by bits per second (bps), bytes per second (Bps), Megabytes per second (Mbps), and Gigabytes per second (Gbps). A CPU transfer rate is determined by it's clock speed. Source :

Clock in a computer is the microchip that regulates the timing and speed of all computer functions. The speed of a computer processor is measured in clock speed, for example, 1MHz is 1 million cycles per second. Source :

10. [Ten](https://ebsoft.web.id/mengenal-apa-itu-ram-memory-ddr-ddr2-dan-ddr3-sdram/)<br>
Memory is the part of the computer that stores data, which is fetched from the hard disk. These days computers use DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) which is faster than it's predecessor, the SDR (Single Data Rate) SDRAM.
The main difference between DDR2, DDR3, and so on is their data rate and power requirement. Each is an improvement from the previous version, for example, DDR2 has 2x the data rate DDR has. DDR3 has higher bandwith and better performance at a lower power consumption.
