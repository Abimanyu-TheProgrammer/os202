# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [What is a thread?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
    a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.


2. [What is a process?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCZ1yxVN4n4)<br>
     process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.

3. [Difference between a process and a thread?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EyzlZxx3g)<br>
    A process is an active program i.e. a program that is under execution. It is more than the program code as it includes the program counter, process stack, registers, program code etc. Compared to this, the program code is only the text section.

    A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler. It improves the application performance using parallelism. A thread shares information like data segment, code segment, files etc. with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter etc.

    Threads are faster to start than processes, because very little memory copying is required (just the thread stack). To start a process, the whole process area must be duplicated for the new process copy to start. While some operating systems only copy memory once it is modified (copy-on-write), this is not universally guaranteed.

4. [What is a single threaded process?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENFeb-J75k)<br>
    Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. In other words, one command is processes at a time.

    The opposite of single threaded processes are multithreaded processes. These processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These are lightweight processes available within the process.

5. [What is a multi threaded process?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENFeb-J75k)<br>
    multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system.

6. [What is a parent process?](http://shivammitra.com/operating%20system/fork-exec-wait-in-operating-system/)<br>
    a parent process is a process that has created one or more child processes.

7. [What is a child process?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOW4zkDZrQ)<br>
    A child process in computing is a process created by another process. This technique pertains to multitasking operating systems, and is sometimes called a subprocess or traditionally a subtask. There are two major procedures for creating a child process: the fork system call and the spawn.

8. [fork() in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-9zg3qfMY)<br>
    The fork system call is used to create a new process. This newly created process is known as child process. The current process which is creating another child process is called the parent process. A child process uses the same program counter, CPU register, same files that are used by the parent process.
    
9. [wait() in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYo6hipaSA)<br>
    A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction.

10. [sleep() in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzSAhHbKKKw)<br>
    C programming language provides sleep() function in order to wait for a current thread for a specified time. slepp() function will sleep given thread specified time for the current executable. Of course, the CPU and other processes will run without a problem.
